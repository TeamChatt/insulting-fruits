# Insulting Fruit

This bot tweets silly things based on a quote we read on Wikipedia about [jujubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube).

> On his visit to Medina, the 19th-century English explorer, Sir Richard Burton, observed that the local variety of jujube fruit was widely eaten. He describes its taste as "like a bad plum, an unrepentant cherry and an insipid apple."

This code based is based on Darius Kazemi's [examplebot](https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot)

## Connecting to Twitter

To run this bot you need to register a Twitter account and also get its "app info".

So create a Twitter account for whatever account you want to tweet this stuff. Twitter doesn't allow you to register multiple twitter accounts on the same email address. I recommend you create a brand new email address (perhaps using Gmail) for the Twitter account. Once you register the account to that email address, wait for the confirmation email. Then go here and log in as the Twitter account for your bot:

https://apps.twitter.com/app/new

Once you're there, fill in the required fields: name, description, website. None of it really matters at all to your actual app, it's just for Twitter's information. Do the captcha and submit.

Next you'll see a screen with a "Details" tab. Click on the "Settings" tab and under "Application Type" choose "Read and Write", then hit the update button at the bottom.

Then go to the Keys and Access Tokens tab, and at the bottom click "create my access token". Nothing might happen immediately. Wait a minute and reload the page. then there should be "access token" and "access token secret", which are both long strings of letters and numbers.

Now use a text editor to open up the "config.js" file. It should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  consumer_key:         'blah',
  consumer_secret:      'blah',
  access_token:         'blah',
  access_token_secret:  'blah'
}
```

In between those quotes, instead of `'blah'`, paste the appropriate info from the Details page. This is essentially the login information for the app.

Now type the following in the command line in your project directory:

`node index.js`
